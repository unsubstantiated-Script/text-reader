# Text Reader -- Chat Buddy

Code for a small Traversy Project. This is the first "special needs" project of I hope many more. In the future, it would be interesting to develop this to aid people with sign language translation needs.

Challenges faced:

- None so far

Todo:
Make it funnier by adding in more arrays depending on category. Ideas include:

- Lawyer
- Politician
- Teacher
- Left
